					<h1>the basics</h1>
				</header>
				<p>I'm a student developer, and I have major ambitions in research! I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Science in astrophsics and computer science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; my expected graduation is Spring 2024. After my undergraduate studies, I'm looking forward to a master's in physics and then potentially a PhD.</p>
				<p>I get very excited about many different fields of science, but my current interests lie in atmospheric and planetary sciences. In the past, I have dived very deep into research about palentology(dinosaurs!), quantum computing, and artifical intelligence. Navigating through these phases, I learned a lot(maybe too much ;) about the natural world and myself. I have settled on a topic, but nothing's to say I cannot diversify!</p>

				<h3><i>Using optical flow to derive horizontal velocities of equatorial plasma bubbles</i></h3>
				<h4 style="margin-bottom: -2.3%">Abstract:</h4>
				<p>Computer vision has been used for a multitude of purposes, but the geosciences have yet to rigorously apply these algorithms to their fields. This paper attempts to use optical flow to calculate and track the velocities of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPB), plasma artifacts that is observed in the upper ionosphere. Previous work in the field has neglected to address the horizontal drift of these bubbles, so using optical flow might introduce new perspectives on the analysis of the data collected. Running the optical flow algorithm on actual data from the NOAA of EPBs, and the results confirm that the artifacts travel east. The significance of these bubbles is seen in scintillation, where data transmissions traveling through these bubbles diffract in unpredictable ways. Having better models will allow communications technology in explaining the reasons data is randomly lost in the atmosphere. Additionally, a better understanding of how the plasma bubbles move and the causes of this movement will lead to a better understanding of our atmosphere and those of other planets.</p>

				<p>I am currently in the process of finding my first undergraduate research project. If you or somebody else can accomodate me, please get in touch! I'm looking forward to working on the cutting edge of science</p>

				<h3>Astronomy</h3>
				<p>idk i've been obsessed about all things space for the longest time</p>
				<p>i am dedicated to spend the rest of my life working with everything space related. hell I'm majoring in astrophys - people don't make money on physics. i'm excited about research and space and everything</p>
				<h3>Learning random stuff</h3>
				<p>whenever i get bored, I end up trying to figure cool stuff out</p>
				<h3>Building random stuff</h3>
				<p>this goes with the last one. i like trying to come up with new stuff, doesn't matter software or hardware</p>
				<p>I'll work with open source libraries, power tools, and CNCs. all for fun.</p>

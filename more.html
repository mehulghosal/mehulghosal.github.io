				<p>I'm a student developer, and I have major ambitions in research! I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Science in astrophsics and computer science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; my expected graduation is Spring 2024. After my undergraduate studies, I'm looking forward to a master's in physics and then potentially a PhD.</p>
				<p>I get very excited about many different fields of science, but my current interests lie in atmospheric and planetary sciences. In the past, I have dived very deep into research about palentology(dinosaurs!), quantum computing, and artifical intelligence. Navigating through these phases, I learned a lot(maybe too much ;) about the natural world and myself. I have settled on a topic, but nothing's to say I cannot diversify!</p>

				<p>I am currently in the process of finding my first undergraduate research project. If you or somebody else can accomodate me, please get in touch! I'm looking forward to working on the cutting edge of science</p>
